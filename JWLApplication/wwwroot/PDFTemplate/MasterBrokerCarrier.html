                            JWL has reviewed the error report from the Carrier, it will issue a
                            final settlement to the Carrier (the <strong>

                            expired, no further disputes will be allowed. Any undisputed items

                            is an independent third party, and not an employee, agent or

                            by proof (such as a signed power of attorney, a written assignment
                            of the claim, or other evidence satisfactory to Carrier) that the

                            The intent of this Agreement is that Carrier maintain a level of
                            service ("<strong>LOS</strong>") equivalent to one-hundred percent
                            (100%) on time completion of all scheduled deliveries within a
                            workday in accordance with the specifics outlined on each SOW. JWL
                            shall monitor Carrier’s performance on a daily basis. Any LOS less
                            than 100% shall be deemed a Service failure and subject Carrier to
                            the financial penalties outlined on that specific SOW, if any. If
                            Carrier has more than one no call/no show or if the LOS under any
                            SOW impairs JWL’s relationship with any Shipper, JWL reserves the
                            right to alter the payment terms under any specific SOW or terminate
                            this Agreement for cause pursuant to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Paragraph 25.</span>

                            </strong> (ii) commercial general liability
                            insurance in the amount of not less than One Million Dollars

                            combined; (iii) automobile liability insurance in the amount of not
                            less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence; and (iv)
                            workers’ compensation insurance in an amount not less than the
                            minimum limits established by applicable statutes and regulations
                            for each state in which it conducts Services on behalf of JWL.
                            Carrier will increase the foregoing limits of insurance as necessary
                            to amounts as may be reasonably requested by JWL, Shipper or as
                            required by applicable statutes or regulations. Carrier’s insurance
                            will be in the form required by applicable regulations and will have
                            no exclusions or restrictions that have not been made known to JWL
                            in writing or that would not be accepted by the DOT in a filing
                            under 49 U.S.C. §13906. Carrier will cause its insurance underwriter
                            or broker to forward to JWL or, at JWL's request, to a Shipper, a
                            standard Certificate of Insurance which will require the insurance
                            provider to give JWL written notice thirty (30) days prior to the
                            cancellation of such insurance. All policies of Carrier insurance
                            will apply as primary insurance without right of contribution from
                            any similar coverage, which may be maintained by JWL or Shipper, and
                            will include a provision waiving underwriters’ rights of subrogation
                            by offset or counterclaim in favor of JWL and Shipper. The Carrier’s
                            Cargo Insurance must be All Risk Broad Form Motor Truck Cargo Legal
                            Liability Coverage, shall have no exclusions or restrictions of any
                            type that would foreseeably preclude coverage relating to cargo
                            claims (such as unattended or unattached trailers or theft) and will
                            designate JWL (and Shipper, if requested by JWL) as a loss payee.
                            The insurance policies described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
                            Paragraph 15 will designate JWL (and Shipper if requested by JWL) as
                            additional insured’s for all claims arising out of Carrier’s
                            performance of Services hereunder. All applicable policy deductibles
                            or self-insured retentions will be the sole responsibility of
                            Carrier. Subject to all other terms and provisions of this
                            Agreement, Carrier agrees that Shipper, and as applicable, JWL as
                            agent or assignee of a claim of Shipper, will have primary recourse
                            against Carrier's Cargo Insurance with respect to any claim by
                            Shipper, and as applicable JWL, for loss of or damage to cargo
                            carried in any shipment sustained between the time the cargo is
                            loaded on Carrier’s equipment at the origin point until delivery and
                            acceptance by the Shipper or Shipper’s customer.

                            directed by JWL, in substantially the same condition as received (reasonable
                            wear and tear excepted). Unless otherwise expressly dictated by JWL in writing,
                            Trailers will not be driven, moved or maintained outside the United States and
                            Trailers will be dedicated exclusively to the Services provided under this
                            Agreement. Carrier will not permit any third party to operate or haul the
                            Trailers and no third-party freight will be placed in the Trailers, except for
                            the designated Shippers. Finally, Trailers may be equipped with cellular or
                            satellite tracking technologies for asset management purposes. Carrier agrees to
                            cooperate with JWL’s asset tracking technology and will not disable or otherwise
                            interfere with the god operation or functionality of such technology.

                            agree to conduct criminal background checks on all drivers prior to each
                            driver’s engagement in the Services. Carrier is encouraged to use InfoMart (a
                            third-party vendor) because it will ensure the checks comply with any applicable
                            Shipper requirements, however, Carrier may use any criminal background check
                            service it desires, as long as such checks meet the requirements established by
                            JWL or a Shipper from time-to-time. Requirements available upon request.
